## Decisions we made:
	-ignore playoffs


## CONCLUSIONS:
	-odds impact betting significantly
	-tunnel method can be very effective
	-betting threshold has big impact (can only make money when you're very confident in predictions)
	-with less perfect markets and better data, probably lots of opportunities to make money (betting on Italian 2nd league soccer draws)
